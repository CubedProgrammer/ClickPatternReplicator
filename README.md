# ClickPatternReplicator
Replicates clicking patterns.

Saves positions of a sequence of clicks and automatically clicks them on demand.

Designed for windows only. Compiling with Visual Studio is recommended, but other compilers should also work.

I believe user32.dll should be linked.

Most of the code is currently untested, once testing is done and bugs are removed, this line will be removed.
